title: 'Powering the van with solar panels'
---

Powering the van for longer trips is something I'm really interested in, as is using renewable energy sources wherever possible, so I thought it would be a great idea to setup a solar panel on the roof.

First of all I've been watching these excellent videos from Josh'sHappiness: [plugin:youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHHeUKxHNzY&t=752s.) and I used that, and the guide to how much wattage you require from the [camping and caravanning club website](http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/helpandadvice/technicalhelp/solar-power/), to select the following:

* [80W 12V Photonic Universe folding solar panel kit](http://amzn.to/2ugTmKx)
* [12V XTREME 110AH AGM LEISURE BATTERY (XR1750)](http://www.alpha-batteries.co.uk/caravan-batteries/12v-xtreme-110ah-agm-leisure-battery-xr1750/)
* [Maplin 12V Modified Sinewave 600W Inverter](http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/maplin-12v-modified-sinewave-600w-inverter-a18fg)
