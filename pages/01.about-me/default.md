Hello there.  My name is Andy.  I'm a developer, currently living in North London in the UK.  I'm starting this site for a few reasons:

1. to try out Grav CMS https://getgrav.org/ I've used and abused Drupal for a numebr of years so im looking to try something new and Grav CMS seems like a great fit.
2. in September this year, ill be leaving the UK for 6 months to go backpacking around Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia & I'm going to document the my plans and the route we take.
3. I also own a very old, (ex French police) Renault Estafette van that I'm slowing converting to a campervan.  I'm a complete novice when it's comes to anything mechanical or woodwork related, so I'm going to keep track of all the work I do on the van, and the trips we make in it so other people can see the pain and pleasure involved.

Any tips, questions please send them over via the [contact page.](/contact)

Cheers!
Andy
