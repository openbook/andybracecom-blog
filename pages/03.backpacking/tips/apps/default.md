**Skyscanner**
Get the cheapest flights fast.

**Maps.me**
My preferred alternative to Google maps because of the ability to offline countries (I offlined all of South East Asia as soon as I downloaded it), and, because it's a collaborative open street maps project, submit back the places you find.

**Monzo & Revolut**
Top up bank cards, easy to top up, disable and best of all have (albeit limited) free international cash withdrawals, I've saved so much money using these cards in the short amount of time I've had them.
