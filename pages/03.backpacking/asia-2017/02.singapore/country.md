Arriving in Singapore we jumped on the MRT, marvelled at the 'NO DURIAN FRUIT' signs, then headed to our hostel 'Inn Crowd' nearby the Little India district.

We arrived late in the afternoon but just in time to head straight out and watch the first of the night's light shows at Spectra at Marina Bay Sands (20:00).  The show combines light and music in a wonderful waters edge setting and was well worth the trip.

We then made the short walk past the Marina Bay hotel to the stunning forest of giant metal trees at Gardens by the Bay where the second light show started at 20:45.  This is a more serene, calming experience, and is ultimately extremely odd to see something so 'green' made from metal and light bulbs.
