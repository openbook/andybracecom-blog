Arriving in Singapore we jumped on the MRT, marvelled at the 'NO DURIAN FRUIT' signs, then headed to our hostel 'Inn Crowd' nearby the Little India district.

We arrived late in the afternoon but just in time to head straight out and watch the first of the night's light shows at Spectra at Marina Bay Sands (20:00).  The show combines light and music in a wonderful waters edge setting and was well worth the trip.

We then made the short walk past the Marina Bay hotel to the stunning forest of giant metal trees at Gardens by the Bay where the second light show started at 20:45.  This is a more serene, calming experience, and is ultimately extremely odd to see something so 'green' made from metal and light bulbs.

As we're trying to keep to a budget, and, Singapore being a very expensive place, we decided to find what free options the city offered.  So, the next day we set of to walk the Kent Ridge in the west of the city.  The walk starts from XXXXX and goes all the way to XXX through a distance of XXXX and features multiple raised walk ways and sheltered canopy walks.  It offered welcome shade and a cooling breeze from the muggy heat of downtown.

At the end of the Kent Ridge Walk we were able to pick up a bus from XXXXXXX and head to Haw Par Villa, the crazy cultural centre built by the two Chinese brothers who found the Tiger Balm company.  The park features many statues and stories depicting faebles on how to lead a good life, the highlight of which was the 18 level's hell.

That evening we decided to hunt out one of the Michelin starred restaurants in Singapore.  We found 'Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle' underneath a residential tower block, the menu was simple, do you want a large or small blowl of noodles.  I went large and a bowl of noodles with pork mince, liver and pork ball appeared with fresh egg noodles and a separate bowl of stock.  It cost S$10.  Yes S$10.  I would seriously eat this every week if I had the chance, the food was delicious.

The next cheap stop for us was the botanical gardens.  We jumped on the MRT and walked through the park, which again offered a nice resbite from the heat.  I really enjoyed the botanical gardens as the size is managable and the rain forest area especially offered great lighting and interesting reading.  We paid to enter the orchid garden, which was also worth the XXXXX fee.  A brand new orchid species is created everytime a visiting dignitary comes to Singapore.  We've now seen the Margret Thatcher Orchid, Beyonce, David Cameron and Barak Obama.  Unfortunately we were just out of season so only a few were visible. 

Finally that night we headed to the historic XXXXX Cinema to watch Blade Runner 2049.  It was ace.
