Bali is a pretty cool first destination on a 6 month trip round Asia and it didn't disappoint.  Only issue that did disappoint was the timely reminder to check visas for **every** country before leaving.  We got to Heathrow Terminal 3 after packing our lives away, excited to get the journey started only to be told we wouldn't be allowed on the Air Garuda flight unless we had proof of leaving Indonesia within the 30 day visa limit.  Queue the Air Asia and Skyscanner apps, and within 20 minutes we had a flight booked from Jakarta to Singapore for Â£30 each.  Air Garuda were great and we landed in Bali, 26 hours later.
