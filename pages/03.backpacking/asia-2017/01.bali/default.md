Bali is a pretty cool first destination on a 6 month trip round Asia and it didn't disappoint.  Only issue that did disappoint was the timely reminder to check visas for **every** country before leaving.  We got to Heathrow Terminal 3 after packing our lives away, excited to get the journey started only to be told we wouldn't be allowed on the Air Garuda flight unless we had proof of leaving Indonesia within the 30 day visa limit.  Queue the Air Asia and Skyscanner apps, and within 20 minutes we had a flight booked from Jakarta to Singapore for Â£30 each.  Air Garuda were great and we landed in Bali, 26 hours later.

### Uluwatu
First stop after a manic exit of Denpasar airport was Bali's souther peninsual, Uluwatu, for my long time very good friends, William McSyddall & Erin Lock Lee.  We stayed in the quiet & friendly, Bingin, spending most of our time descending down the steep steps to Bingin beach & the neighbouring Dreamland beach where took some surfing lessons with The Dawn Patrol.  These beaches were absolutely perfect for our level - i.e. 'have tried previously but have no way of doing it regularly in the UK beginnger level'.  Edu and his gang were good fun to surf with and pushed us on to enough waves for everyone to see the whole group up and on the boards, although, our technique maybe didn't improve as much as we'd hoped. ![](2017-10-01%2012.17.36.jpg "Surfing on Dreamland beach")

Having now seen more of the rest of Bali, I can now say Bingin was relatively under deverloped and is well worth a visit, especially for the sun downers and views from the beach.  Other sights we visited in Ulawatu were **Ulawatu Temple** - I had an amazingly cold and refreshing coconut here, other than that, not much to report, **Pentai Uluwatu & Single Fin** for amazing views of the pros surfing an amazing reef break.  

### Canggu
We arrived in Canggu far too early in our trip.  It was too much like being close to home, and was full of hipsters, ex-pats, massive clubs & bars and cafes serving soul bowls and organic bee pollen & chia smoothies.  Maybe if we'd been away in deepest darkest Asia, away from all of this stuff for months already, then it could possibly have been a welcomed break, but, it wasn't and I was happy to leave.  One exception to this was our night at a road side Bakso seller eating a classic vegetarian dish of tofu stuffed with pork, yum, and our sunset excursion to the sea temple at Tannah Lot.

While staying in Canggu we decided to get on with our PADI diving course, which we took with [Aqua Marine Diving](http://www.aquamarinediving.com/) based in Kuta.  After some initial concerns about the school / instructor (our initial confined water dives were made in a hotel swimming pool that had unfortunately turned green because of the previous night's rainfall, and, there was a language barrier to overcome with our instructor Marta) we had two days open water diving at the Blue Lagoon near Padang Bai, and then Gili Selang.  Once in the water and communicating via hand signals, we found Marta to be a great instructor who made you feel comfortable with the task you were learning, as well as showing us some amazing coral and sealife.  The second day's dive was especially good, we were diving some very experienced divers & diving photographers who ranked the day high on their list of dives.

### Ubud
We moved to Ubud after 5 days in Canggu and stayed in the [Happy Mango Tree](https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/the-happy-mango-tree.en-gb.html?aid=357011;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-id-theNhappyNmangoNtree-unspec-id-com-L%3Aen-O%3AosSx-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=5e41522cc59ca563c26a272dcded65d9;dist=0&sb_price_type=total&type=total&) hostel close to the centre.  I totally recommend this place, despite it looking a bit shabby and needing a repaint, our balcony door opened out on to a rice terrace where we were sung to sleep every night by the local frog population.

Highlights in Ubud were the **Sacred Monkey Forest** for a couple of hours with the monkeys and also, a welcome respite from the sun in the cool shady forest.  Getting up early for the fairly easy **Campuhan Ridge Walk** that starts close to the centre of town & runs alongside two rivers and nearby rice terraces.  Seeing the **Tegalalang rice terraces**.

### Kuta Lombok
We left Ubud early via a shuttle bus that picked us up from our hotel, took us to Padang Bai, and after a little bit of uncertainty got us on to the slow, public ferry to Lembar, Lombok, for 150K IDR.  We preferred the public ferry because it was cheaper, and, we're happy to take the slower, methods of transport and experience the journey like the rest of the country would.  The ferry is fully, mostly of drivers transporting moped and other goods between Bali and Lombok, so most people were catching up on some sleep.  The rest of us were watching Fast & Furious 8 in the main air conditioned room (shortly after a short karaoke intro before the boat left).

Arriving in **Lembar** we were initially a bit concerned about the **"Taxi Mafia"** that were supposedly awaiting our arrival.  We ignored them all and walked the 1km to the first main roundabout where we met a lady asking offering to take us to Kuta Lombok for 200K IDR, this was a little more than some of the 'offers' we'd received leaving the harbour, but, we felt more comfortable with the wife and husband combo and were rewarded with some lovely chat and free tasty snacks.

Driving through Lombok to Kuta, it was immediately obvious that this island didn't seem anywhere as busy as Bali, at least from the tourist perspective, and there was a lot more agricultural land in use on our drive.  


### The Gilis
