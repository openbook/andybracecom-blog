Having spent a few days in the big city lights of Singaore, we chose to skip the congested city of Manila and caught a connecting flight to Dumaguete on Negros Island.  Arriving at the tiny airport we got in a motortaxi and headed to our excellent hostel, The Flying Fish.  Dumaguete is great for diving and snorkelling trips to nearby Apo Island, we took a tour with XXXXXXX and happily spent a day checking out some amazing coral reefs and the local turtle population.  Also, be sure to check out 'Adamo' restaurant whilst in Dumaguete for some quality food prepared by a local chef who worked in kitchens in Europe.

From Dumaguete we took the local ferry to Siquijor, staying at Tori's backpacker paradise on the south of the Island.  Highlight of Siquijor were the magic tree fish pool (?), waterfalls and the beach on the east of the island where we found the locals jumping off natural rock dive boards at 6 and 10m.  One tip, when it comes to leaving the Island make sure you check the route off when arriving as it turned out our ferry to Bohol island was broken in need of repair on the day we left.  Not a problem as we stayed an extra night at the amazing Casa de la Playa Beach Resort in Sandugan nearby to Larena.

Bohol is a beatiful island and we used Tagbilaran as our base to explore the Chocolate Hills (a fairly long 2hrs motorbike journey), unfortunately we did not have enough time to visit the nearby Tarsier Sanctuary.  On our second day we moved to Panglao, a fairly well built up tourist area on the south west corner of the island where we spent some time diving at the amazing Balicasag island.

We left Bohol the same we arrived, and caught a slow ferry from Tagbilaran to Cebu City where the next morning we made the short flight to Busuanga Island and Coron City.  We spent 1 day visiting nearby Coron Island and the Baracuda lake [AND OTHER SITES HERE].  The next 2 days were devoted to our advanced PADI diving course with the Reggae Divers.
